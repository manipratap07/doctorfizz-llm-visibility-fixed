      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
      <p>
        DoctorFizz uses your website or business name and aliases to identify
        brand mentions in captured answers. Your five questions are sent to the
        selected chatbot websites as written, after trimming outer whitespace,
        including any brand details you put in them. We store each question,
        source status, captured answer and evidence with the result.
      </p>
      <h2>Essential cookie and limits</h2>
      <p>
        A signed HTTP-only visitor cookie tracks your free checks for 30 days. A
        salted IP hash supports daily abuse controls. We do not store raw IP
        addresses. Your host must configure its trusted proxy correctly.
      </p>
      <h2>Retention and public result links</h2>
      <p>
        Result links contain unguessable IDs and remain accessible to anyone
        with the link for seven days. Avoid entering confidential information.
        Allowance records and profiles expire after 31 days. New browser checks
        do not reuse response caches. Lead details expire after 90 days.
      </p>
      <h2>Provider processing</h2>
      <p>
        Selected chatbot websites process your chosen prompt under their
        respective policies. Bot verification is optional; signed sessions,
        daily limits and queue limits apply. There are no advertising trackers
        in this build.
      </p>
      <h2>Audit requests</h2>
      <p>
        Your contact details are saved only when you submit the audit form with
        consent. They are used to respond to that request.
      </p>
      <h2>Delete your data</h2>
      <p>
        You can remove the brand information, responses and lead details
        associated with this browser. Hashed allowance records remain until
        expiry to protect the free service.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project owner must add the legal controller identity and privacy
        contact before public launch.
