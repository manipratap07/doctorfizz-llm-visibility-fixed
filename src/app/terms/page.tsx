      <p>
        This free tool reports snapshots from public chatbot websites. It does
        not guarantee visibility, traffic, sales or a permanent position.
        Browser answers can differ from consumer applications.
      </p>
      <h2>Use and limits</h2>
      <p>
        Write your own five questions to check websites and brands you are
        authorised to analyse. Do not submit sensitive data or use the service
        to bypass provider safeguards. One batch of five questions across
        selected providers is one check. Five checks are available per 30-day
        visitor window, subject to daily and worker capacity limits.
      </p>
      <h2>Availability and evidence</h2>
      <p>
        Unavailable providers are excluded from the score. If every provider
        fails, the allowance is refunded. Each new check captures a fresh
        browser response. Verify the raw answer before making a business
        decision.
      </p>
      <h2>Independent service</h2>
      <p>
        DoctorFizz is not affiliated with the listed AI providers. Their names
        identify the source of each browser response. All trademarks belong to
        their respective owners.
      </p>
      <h2>Public launch</h2>
      <p>
        The project owner must add legal entity details, jurisdiction and a
        contact address before public launch.
